Generating words is easy , but putting them together is hard . Small words like state or data might be easy , but big words like interoperability , or unusual words like pizzazz and kwyjibo may also be tough . Bidding 6 spades in a bridge game , and making it for 1430 point is also tough , but it is not clear how easy that is to generate artificially . What about words like Statistics , Frequentist , Bayesian , asymptotics ?
